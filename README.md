The "EnemGo!" was developed to carry out the Completion of Course Work at Colégio Clóvis Bevilacquá. To obtain the certificate, it was mandatory to use specific languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Markup Language), PHP (Programming Language), VB.NET (Programming Language), JavaScript (Programming Language) and SQL (Programming Language), in addition, the MySql database (Database Management System).

The choice of project was made based on the perception that one of the main concerns of teenagers in high school is the need to enroll in a college, where the means most used by the Brazilian population is the ENEM. With that in mind, the project was created to help students perform well in the exam, with numerous contents to complement their knowledge.

Through this, the platform has several resources that seek to bring a wide variety for the student to be able to study and obtain their results. The site starts with the Initial Screen, where you can find information about the platform, and make those who access it interested in the content, after completing the registration and login, the user has access to all the didactic content of the application, it contains the screens Study Plan, Subjects, Simulations, Writing, Question Bank and My Profile.

In short, among the screens mentioned, you can access video lessons, pdf exercises, mental maps, support material, weekly script, themes and correction of essays, and several questions of all subjects charged by the exam.

The website's design seeks to bring a clean look, with just two different colors that together form a delicate gradient, seeking to bring harmony to the screens. The buttons and shapes that are presented are all in rounded or even round formats, this is because they are more attractive to the eye according to research. In addition to seeking to draw attention to the content, the project has a design that seeks to visually draw the attention of users, bringing comfort to anyone who uses it.

Obs.: The programming in VB.NET was entirely used to make the administrative part of the platform, it can be found in the "VB.NET" repository.
